# SQLite_Test
SQLite management function testing in Python
The purpose of this code, and this git, is to practice.  There is some actual application for the code but the primary purpose is to be more familiar with version working and software development with git.  THe code will cover SQL syntax and using a db instead of a flat file system for saving/editing/reading from a program.
